This is a website that allows you to keep track of products by entering their name, price and the year in which they were purchased. 

It uses a special programming approach called Object Oriented Programming to make it work. 

You can also delete products that are no longer needed. 

The website has a modern look and user-friendly features, such as interactive messages that tell you when products have been added or deleted.
